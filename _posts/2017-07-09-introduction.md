As a purist, I see programming as an activity that can exist on its own. It does not depend on what programming language you use, operating system you are working on, your gender, and religion. You see, a program is simply a set of instructions. A programmer simply writes in these instructions to manipulate a computer to do what she wants.

Having said that, in reality each programming language imposes different sets of rules and sometimes way of thinking. For Javascript, some would view it as a more forgiving language, in a sense that many browsers would still execute your program when it contains minor mistakes. It could be a double-edged sword.

## Javascript vs. the rest
Also, in contrast with many other general purpose languages such as `C`, `Java` and `python`, Javascript lives almost exclusively in the web browsers. Despite this limitation, it is in every bit as powerful as other languages. And hence, learning how to program in Javascript would allow you to pick up other languages.

However, one should take note that because Javascript's main purpose is to be the language of the web, it has built-in support for specialized tasks such as `HTML DOM` manipulation, `AJAX` calls, and browser specific extensions. You should not confuse these parts of Javascript as "Javascript programming", as Javascript is capable of far beyond those. After understanding the 'basics' of what programming is all about, though, will make you more proficient in employing those web-specific tasks.

Not to mention many more distractions such as a gazillion of Javascript libraries (I'm not joking, it's that many!) from the old staples such as jQuery to the newer and modern ones such as React and Angular (although in the front-end world, they are not considered trendy and shiny anymore, having existed for a few years). They are front-end libraries that one day will be of value to you, but at this point, they are completely irrelevant.

## Conclusion
Finally, most of the things you learn from this series of tutorials will be transferable to any other programming languages. You will be able to write programs that solve your own problems, automate tasks, and increase your productivity in ways you can never imagine. Hence, this will be a very rewarding journey.

And with that, I welcome you this learning journey.
