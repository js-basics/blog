title: Tutorial 1 - Variables and Types
---
This is the beginning of all. Variables. This might remind you of those dark hours in math classes. Well, the idea is similar, but much simpler.

You see, when computers execute a program, it reads in an instruction one at a time. Then, based on the instruction, it will modify its `state`, from current state to the next state. This state is stored in a `variable`. It is simply a piece of memory which is identifiable by a name.

> Note: You can follow along this tutorial using any browser console log (`Cmd + Opt + J` to open it on Chrome) and type in the code line by line (or simply copy paste the code chunks). You don't have to setup `.js` files as discussed in Tutorial 0 yet. The console log gives you an interactive means to play with the variables. Go crazy.

## Variable Declaration
Before we can _use_ a variable, we have to _declare_ it first. It is like giving a name to a baby. Before you can refer to that baby by name, you have to name the baby first. Of course!

In javascript, the way we do so is by typing the following:

{% highlight javascript %}
var myVariable = 1;
{% endhighlight %}

That line declares a variable called `myVariable` and assigns a value of `1` to it. `var` is the keyword that we use to tell Javascript that, "Hey, I'm declaring this new variable called myVariable". This is a very important step, which will be made clear to you once you understand the concept of `scope`. For now, just remember, that a variable does not exist until it is declared.

Once declared, we can manipulate it.

{% highlight javascript %}
var myVariable = 1;
console.log(myVariable);  // Prints '1'.
myVariable = myVariable + 5;
console.log(myVariable);  // Prints '6'.
{% endhighlight %}
> Wait, what is that double-slash-thingy? It is called a "comment", and it is not executed (or even seen) by our program. Hence it is used for, you guess it, commenting our codes.

Right. For new programmers, this might be quite confusing. Let me go through it line by line.

First, we declare `myVariable` and set it to 1.

Then we call `console.log(myVariable)`, which prints the content of `myVariable` to the console. Since `myVariable` contains `1`, it prints `1`. Simple.

Then we see `myVariable = myVariable + 5`. This should not be confused with the mathematical notation we learn in school (because when you do so, you will get 0 = 5 after eliminating myVariable from both sides, which is absurd!). Here, we learn something important, that `=` means **assignment**, not _equality_. In fact, equality is written as `==` in Javascript (or even `===`, which we will discuss next time).

So, what we are really doing, is to assign `myVariable` with some other value we specified on the right hand side of `=`. What is on the right hand side? it is `myVariable + 5`. What was in `myVariable`? It was `1`. So really, the right hand side is simply `1 + 5` if you substitute `myVariable` with its value which is `1`.

Hence `myVariable = myVariable + 5` indeed translates to `myVariable = 1 + 5`, which means we are assigning `myVariable` with a new value, `6`.

The last line, `console.log(myVariable)`, although looks exactly the same as the one comes before it, prints a different value `6` which is currently contained in `myVariable`. Here you see that programming is indeed an exercise of asking the computer to perform a series of instructions **sequentially**.

## Types of Variables
In the previous example, `myVariable` contains an integer. In general, there are 5 basic types: `int`, `double`, `boolean`, `char` and `string`.
- `int`: All integers such as `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, and so on. Also, negative numbers such as `-1`, `-2`, and so on.
- `double`: Numbers other than integers, which is usually called _real number_ in math classes, such as `1.563`, `3.1415`, `-20.0`, and `0.0`.
- `boolean`: Truth values, which is either `true` or `false`. Nothing in between.
- `char`: ASCII characters, like `'a'`, `'b'`, `'A'`, `'!'`, `'.'`, `'1'`, and so on. ASCII is by itself interesting, because it maps the integers 0-255 to one of those alphabets and many more. Why? Because of reasons explained later.
- `string`: A sequence of characters, which we human refer to as a _text_. For example, `"Hello World!"` is a `string` which contains 12 characters.

Why do computers need "types"? This is because at the machine level, everything that computer deals with is just a string of 0s and 1s. When it sees a sequence of 0s and 1s (called `bit`s), it needs to know how to interpret it. By telling the computer that what it currently sees is of a certain type, it can then interpret it accordingly. For example, `01100011` can mean a character `c` if it's a `char`, or `99` if it's an `int`.

Interestingly, in order to represent readable characters ('a'-'z', 'A'-'Z', even digits '0'-'9', and so on), we need to map those sequence of bits to characters. Hence, ASCII is one standard that allow us to represent 8 bits (a sequence of 8 `0`s and `1`s such as `01100011`) to an agreed upon character which all computer in the world use. Now, 8 bits is called a `byte`. That's why most of the time we refer to a size of a file by number of bytes, because we can see them as a string of characters, 1 byte in size each. There you have it.

## Interaction between types
Different types will behave differently when operated upon. For example:

{% highlight javascript %}
var name = "Robert";
var helloMessage = "Hello, " + name + "!";
console.log(helloMessage);  // Prints "Hello, Robert!".
{% endhighlight %}

In this scenario, `name` is a `string`, hence when operated using `+`, a string concatenation is performed.

Compare it to the one below:
{% highlight javascript %}
var x = 1;
var y = 2;
console.log(x + y);  // Prints '3'.
{% endhighlight %}

In contrast, since `x` and `y` are integers, when operated by `+`, an arithmetic addition is performed instead, resulting in a `3`.

How about this one?
{% highlight javascript %}
var x = "12";  // Notice that this is a string!
var y = 2;  // While this one is an integer.
console.log(x + y) // Prints '122', not 14!
{% endhighlight %}

Here you can see how understanding types is crucial in writing and understanding your program. Since `x` is a `string`, and `y` is an `int`, when operated using `+`, what we get is that the integer `y` is being concatenated to the string `x`. This is because, in Javascript, if an addition to a `string` will result in concatenation operation.

Also, the types of the variable will determine the set of operations that is _legal_. For example, the following operation is gibberish to a computer:

{% highlight javascript %}
var x = "baba";
var y = 1;
console.log(x - y);  // Prints 'NaN' which means 'Not a Number'.
{% endhighlight %}

Here I arrive at another point. In most other languages, gibberish operation such as this, where we try to subtract a string "baba" by a number 1, would simply cause an error (i.e. the program just gives up trying an report to you, the programmer, that you are asking for the moon). However, Javascript has a different philosophy. It acts like a yes-man which will try to do whatever his superior demands, and will sweep bad news under the rug. In this case, it still performs the absurd operation `"baba" - 1`, and returns `NaN`. `NaN` is a special value to indicate that the result of the operation is not a number. You, the programmer, has to check manually for this value before you are sure that you can operate on the value, which can easily become a tedious exercise. So, in general, we do not want to depend on this kind of behavior, and make sure that we are indeed performing "legal" operations.

## Playground
Using `console log`, see what you get for each of these chunk of codes.
#### 1. Understanding assignment.
{% highlight javascript %}
var text = "May";
text = "Hi, " + text + "! how are you doing?";
console.log(text);
{% endhighlight %}

#### 2. Can you guess what is the result?
{% highlight javascript %}
var x = 5;
var y = 7;
x = y + x;
y = x - y;
console.log(y);
{% endhighlight %}

#### 3. Are they the same?
{% highlight javascript %}
var val = true;
var valString = "true";
console.log(val == valString);
{% endhighlight %}

#### 4. I want to see double!
{% highlight javascript %}
var x = 5;
var y = 3;
console.log(x/y);
{% endhighlight %}

#### 5. Are they equal?
{% highlight javascript %}
var x = 1;
var y = -1;
var z = 0;
console.log(x + y == z);
{% endhighlight %}

#### 6. They should be the same right? Hmm?
{% highlight javascript %}
var x = 0.1;
var y = 0.2;
var z = 0.3;
console.log(x + y == z);
{% endhighlight %}
> In fact, they are not! Don't be alarmed though, this does not mean that the computer is broken. It is just that the way computers store "real" numbers are not like us human. They store it in the form of 0s and 1s, so it cannot store all real numbers in the exact manner. Specifically in this case, the addition `0.1 + 0.2` actually returns `0.30000000000000004` (try it!), due to a small shift in precisions. Hence, programmers should never perform equality check on type `double`, as it might not always be like what you expect!

#### 7. A little bit of fun. What will be printed here?
{% highlight javascript %}
var x = 10;
x = x - 4;
if (x > 6) {
  console.log("x is bigger than six!");
} else {
  console.log("x is at most six.");
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Non-primitive types
Since I call the types in the previous section "primitive", you might wonder, what about the "modern" types? Well, there are "non-primitive" types, which really belong to a group we call _data structure_. We will discuss about simple data structures later on over the course of these tutorials. You will realize that they are nothing more than ways to organize a combination of these primitive types.

In fact, you have actually seen one data structure, which is the `string` type. It is a linear data strcture where we place a series of `char` consecutively one next to the other. This is a subset of data structure called an `array`, which we will discuss in detail too. Wait a minute, why did I call it a primitive then? Well, many languages such as Javascript treat it as a first-class value type which can be easily constructed, hence we can safely think about it as a "primitive" value.

As this is a more advanced topic, we will discuss it in a more appropriate time.

## Conclusion
This concludes our types lawyering which is an appropriate introduction on programming in general. Indeed, whatever we will learn next, will relate to how we can manipulate and take advantage of these various types of variables. Hence, a general understanding of the different types that exist and how different types could potentially interact with each other will prove to be a valuable asset to you.
